# PHP Ecommerce Site

An Ecommerce site written in PHP for a second year module at university. The goal of the module was to have it solely in PHP as much as possible, so some pieces are less performant/readable than they could have been.

The site allows for admin access to add items, and both guest and user access for placing orders.

It integrates with a MySQL Database.
